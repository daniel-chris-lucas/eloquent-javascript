    <h1>Bean Counting</h1>

    <p>
        You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N),<br>
        similar to how you get its length with "s".length . The returned value will be a string <br>
        containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, <br>
        which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1 . In other words, <br>
        a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number <br>
        that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs , except it takes a second <br>
        argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only <br>
        uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

    <script>
        var countBs = function (word) {
            var foundOccurrences = 0;

            for (var i = 0; i <= word.length; i++) {
                if (word.charAt(i).toLowerCase() === 'b') {
                    foundOccurrences++;
                }
            }

            return foundOccurrences;
        };

        console.log(countBs("beanbagbubble"));
