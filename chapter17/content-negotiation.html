    <h1>Content negotiation</h1>

    <p>
        One of the things that HTTP can do, but that we have not discussed in this chapter, <br>
        is called content negotiation. The Accept header for a request can be used to tell <br>
        the server what type of document the client would like to get. Many servers ignore <br>
        this header, but when a server knows of various ways to encode a resource, it can <br>
        look at this header and send the one that the client prefers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The URL eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond with either plaintext, <br>
        HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for. These formats are identified by <br>
        the standardized media types text/plain, text/html, and application/json.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the setRequestHeader <br>
        method of your XMLHttpRequest object to set the header named Accept to one of the <br>
        media types given earlier. Make sure you set the header after calling open but <br>
        before calling send.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and see what happens.
