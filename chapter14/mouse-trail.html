    <h1>Mouse trail</h1>

    <p>
      In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with lots of animated <br>
      images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these was the “mouse trail”—a series of images that would follow the mouse pointer as <br>
      you moved it across the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely positioned &lt;div&gt; <br>
      elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section <br>
      for an example). Create a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake <br>
      of the mouse pointer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as simple or as complex as you <br>
      want. A simple solution to start with is to keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through <br>
      them, moving the next one to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.
    </p>

    <script>
      var dots = [];

      for (var i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
        var node = document.createElement('div');
        node.className = 'trail';
        document.body.appendChild(node);
        dots.push(node);
      }

      var currentDot = 0;

      addEventListener('mousemove', function (event) {
        var dot = dots[currentDot];
        dot.style.left = (event.pageX - 3) + "px";
        dot.style.top = (event.pageY - 3) + "px";
        currentDot = (currentDot + 1) % dots.length;
      })
    </script>
</body>
