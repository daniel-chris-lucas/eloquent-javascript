    <h1>Censored keyboard</h1>

    <p>
      Between 1928 and 2013, Turkish law forbade the use of the letters Q, W, and X in official <br>
      documents. This was part of a wider initiative to stifle Kurdish culture—those letters <br>
      occur in the language used by Kurdish people but not in Istanbul Turkish.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an exercise in doing ridiculous things with technology, I’m asking you to program a text <br>
      field (an &lt;input type="text"&gt; tag) that these letters cannot be typed into.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <input type="text">
    </p>

    <script>
      var field = document.querySelector("input");

      field.addEventListener("keydown", function (event) {
        if (event.keyCode == "Q".charCodeAt(0) ||
            event.keyCode == "W".charCodeAt(0) ||
            event.keyCode == "X".charCodeAt(0)) {
              event.preventDefault();
        }
      });
    </script>
</body>
