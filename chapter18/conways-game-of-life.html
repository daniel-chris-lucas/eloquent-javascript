    <h1>Conway's game of life</h1>

    <p>
        Conway’s Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial “life” on <br>
        a grid, each cell of which is either live or not. Each generation (turn), the <br>
        following rules are applied:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors <br>
                dies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next <br>
                generation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one square <br>
        at a time. That means the counting of neighbors is based on the situation at <br>
        the start of the generation, and changes happening to neighbor cells during <br>
        this generation should not influence the new state of a given cell.
    </p>
    <p>
        Implement this game using whichever data structure you find appropri- ate. <br>
        Use Math.random to populate the grid with a random pattern initially. Display <br>
        it as a grid of checkbox fields, with a button next to it to ad- vance to the <br>
        next generation. When the user checks or unchecks the checkboxes, their changes <br>
        should be included when computing the next generation.
