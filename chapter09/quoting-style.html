    <h1>Quoting style</h1>

    <p>
        Imagine you have written a story and used single quotation marks through- out to mark pieces of <br>
        dialogue. Now you want to replace all the dialogue quotes with double quotes, while keeping the <br>
        single quotes used in contractions like arenâ€™t.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two kinds of quote usage and craft a call to the replace <br>
        method that does the proper replacement.
