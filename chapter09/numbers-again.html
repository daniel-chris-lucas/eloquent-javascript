    <h1>Numbers again</h1>

    <p>
        A series of digits can be matched by the simple regular expression /\d+/.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must support an optional <br>
        minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal dot, and exponent notation—5e-3 or <br>
        1E10— again with an optional sign in front of the exponent. Also note that it is not necessary <br>
        for there to be digits in front of or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That <br>
        is, .5 and 5. are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn’t.
