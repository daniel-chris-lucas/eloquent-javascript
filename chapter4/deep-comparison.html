    <h1>Deep Comparison</h1>

    <p>
        The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would prefer to compare the values of <br>
        their actual properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a function, deepEqual , that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or <br>
        are objects with the same properties whose values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to <br>
        deepEqual .
    </p>
    <p>
        To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the === operator for that) or by looking at <br>
        their properties, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should <br>
        do a deep comparison.
    </p>
