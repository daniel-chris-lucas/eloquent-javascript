    <h1>Sequence interface</h1>

    <p>
        Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of values. An object that provides <br>
        this interface represents a sequence, and the interface must somehow make it possible for code that <br>
        uses such an object to iterate over the sequence, looking at the element values it is made up of and <br>
        having some way to ﬁnd out when the end of the sequence is reached. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have speciﬁed your interface, try to write a function logFive that takes a sequence object and <br>
      calls console.log on its ﬁrst ﬁve elements — or fewer, if the sequence has fewer than ﬁve elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then implement an object type ArraySeq that wraps an array and allows iteration over the array using the <br>
      interface you designed. Implement another object type RangeSeq that iterates over a range of integers <br>
      (taking from and to arguments to its constructor) instead.
