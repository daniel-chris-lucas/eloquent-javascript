    <h1>Fizz Buzz</h1>

    <p>
        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
        to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
        instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
        "Buzz" instead.<br>
        When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" ,
        for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
        "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

        for (var number = 1; number <= 100; number++) {
            var result = '';

            if (number % 3 === 0) {
                result += 'Fizz';
            }

            if (number % 5 === 0) {
                result += 'Buzz';
            }

            console.log(result || number);
        }
