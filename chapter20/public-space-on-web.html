    <h1>A public space on the web</h1>

    <p>
        Since the file server serves up any kind of file and even includes the <br>
        right Content-Type header, you can use it to serve a website. Since it <br>
        allows everybody to delete and replace files, it would be an interesting <br>
        kind of website: one that can be modified, vandalized, and destroyed by <br>
        everybody who takes the time to create the right HTTP request. Still, <br>
        it would be a website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Write a basic HTML page that includes a simple JavaScript file. Put the <br>
        files in a directory served by the file server and open them in your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, as an advanced exercise or even a weekend project, combine all the <br>
        knowledge you gained from this book to build a more user-friendly <br>
        interface for modifying the website from inside the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use an HTML form (Chapter 18) to edit the content of the files that make <br>
        up the website, allowing the user to update them on the server by using <br>
        HTTP requests as described in Chapter 17.
    </p>
    <p>
        Start by making only a single file editable. Then make it so that the user <br>
        can select which file to edit. Use the fact that our file server returns <br>
        lists of files when reading a directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Donâ€™t work directly in the code on the file server, since if you make a <br>
        mistake you are likely to damage the files there. Instead, keep your work <br>
        outside of the publicly accessible directory and copy it there when testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your computer is directly connected to the Internet, without a fire-wall, <br>
        router, or other interfering device in between, you might be able to invite <br>
        a friend to use your website. To check, go to whatismyip.com, copy the <br>
        IP address it gives you into the address bar of your browser, and add :8000 <br>
        after it to select the right port. If that brings you to your site, it <br>
        is online for everybody to see.
