    <h1>Creating directories</h1>

    <p>
        Though the DELETE method is wired up to delete directories (using fs.rmdir), <br>
        the file server currently does not provide any way to create a directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Add support for a method MKCOL , which should create a directory by calling <br>
        fs.mkdir. MKCOL is not one of the basic HTTP methods, but it does exist, <br>
        for this same purpose, in the WebDAV standard, which specifies a set of <br>
        extensions to HTTP, making it suitable for writing resources, not just <br>
        reading them.
