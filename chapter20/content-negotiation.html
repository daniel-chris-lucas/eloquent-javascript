    <h1>Content negotiation, again</h1>

    <p>
        In Chapter 17, the first exercise was to make several requests to <br>
        eloquent-javascript.net/author, asking for different types of content <br>
        by passing different Accept headers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do this again, using Node’s http.request function. Ask for at least the <br>
        media types text/plain, text/html, and application/json. Remember that <br>
        headers to a request can be given as an object, in the headers property <br>
        of http.request’s first argument.
    </p>

    <p>Write out the content of the responses to each request.</p>
